# mapty-app
This is a fun training app made in javascript, in which you can enter a workout and it will be registered on a map in your current position geographically.

## Description

This app is made with the help of Jonas Schedtman to work on topics such as OOP and modern javascript syntax both in the implementation of priority properties and the use of bid to use functions within the methods of a particular class and to access the properties of this class, without breaking the code.

We also implemented a library to be able to use a map type canvas and the browser API to take the user's current coordinates to paint the pieces of training on that map.

in summary, this app is full of amir and many crazy things, you must open it from the google browser because this syntax of private properties is not available in other browsers.

## How to use it.

you just have to click on the map place where you trained and fill in the form data, if you try to enter negative data or strings you will get an error message.
